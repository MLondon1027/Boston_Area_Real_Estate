What problem am I trying to solve?

Proposal 1) I am trying to solve the problem of predicting sale prices for real estate in the Boston metro area.
Proposal 2) I am trying to predict which properties will sell in the next 12 months. This will be useful for real estate agents to know 
who to direct their marketing efforts towards.

Where I am obtaining my data?

As a licensed real estate agent in Massachusetts, I am able to pull data from the Massachusetts MLS. Data includes last sale date, last sale price, year built, 
levels, bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, style, basement, condition, etc.

I will pull the data from the 231 zip codes listed on bestplaces.net as zip codes that are part of the Boston-Cambridge-Newton Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
I will look at data from the past 10 years.

Models and Feature Engineering

Proposal 1)
I am planning on using time series, linear regression and other regression based models to determine predicted sale price.
Proposal 2)
I am planning on using random forest, knn, and other classifiers to determine if the home is likely to sell in the next 12 months

Feature engineering could include adding sale price/square foot
